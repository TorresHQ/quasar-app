              Silver is a true feline character in his home! With his mischievous personality and
              determination, he definitely keeps everyone on their toes.
              However, his affectionate nature and love for being on the lap and bed
              show that he is also a kitty who values moments of closeness with his parents.
              His aversion to water is a classic trait of cats.
              Although he may not be the most careful cat when it comes to the litter box,
              his sweetness makes up for it!

              Golden, on the other hand, is the wiser cat of the pair. His cleverness and ability to
              learn from Silver's mistakes showcase his intelligence. His calmness and attention to
              his own way are qualities that make him so endearing. The way he sleeps is a constant
              source of amusement for the family. His more reserved approach to affection and the tendency
              to cover his waste in the litter box demonstrate a sense of organization and privacy.
